# nursing-home-medicaid-application
Need to apply for chronic care medicaid? See Medicaid-binder-blank.pdf for a blank version of the application I submitted. 

Maybe it will serve as inspiration to you.

Because the applicant was both under the age of 65 and disabled, we had the option to use a NYSARC pooled special needs trust to shelter the applicant's assets. We opened up a funeral trust and a special needs trust to shelter assets.

For the retirement account, we converted the asset to an income stream using monthly payments that were sufficiently large that they are expected to drain the account before the applicant dies, using a social security administration (SSA) actuarial table.

The whole thing is super byzantine and took me about 20 days, but I was able to take care of everything without hiring a lawyer.
