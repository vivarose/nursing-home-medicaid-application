# nursing-home-medicaid-application
Need to apply for chronic care medicaid? See Medicaid-binder-blank.pdf for a blank version of the application I submitted. 

Maybe it will serve as inspiration to you. NOTE: I do not promise to keep these documents up-to-date. This is only provided as an example as of December 2025. I am not a lawyer.

This template is especially relevant for the rare applicant who is disabled, below 65 years old, and living in a nursing home. 

A nursing home costs over $10k/month, so almost no one can pay for it out of pocket forever. Almost everyone in long term care ends up depending on Chronic Care Medicaid. You can private pay until you run out of money, and then get Medicaid, but that's not what we did.

At first, the applicant had too much money (assets). 
Because the applicant was both under the age of 65 and disabled, we had the option to use a NYSARC pooled special needs trust to shelter the applicant's assets. We opened up a funeral trust and a special needs trust to shelter assets.

For the retirement account, we converted the asset to an income stream using monthly payments that were sufficiently large that they are expected to drain the retirement account before the applicant dies, using a social security administration (SSA) actuarial table.

The whole thing is super byzantine and took me almost a month to set up and document, but I was able to take care of everything without hiring a lawyer.

The applicant has too much income as well -- it's capped at $50/month income (https://aging.ny.gov/raise-personal-needs-allowance-pna) -- but that isn't disqualifying. It just means the applicant needs to pay the rest of the income (NAMI) to the nursing home each month.

## **RETIREMENT FUNDS: periodic payments**

**GIS 98 MA/024:**
> "Once an individual is in receipt of or has applied for periodic payments, the principal in the retirement fund is not a countable resource. This includes situations where a Medicaid applicant has already elected less than the maximum periodic payment amount and this election is irrevocable. In such situations, only the periodic payment amount received is counted as income and the principal is disregarded as a resource."

(but the periodic payments must be sufficiently large that they could reasonably get the balance down to zero)
