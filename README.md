# nursing-home-medicaid-application
Need to apply for chronic care medicaid? See Medicaid-binder-blank.pdf for a blank version of the application I submitted. 

Maybe it will serve as inspiration to you.

A nursing home costs over $10k/month, so almost no one can pay for it out of pocket forever. Everyone ends up depending on Chronic Care Medicaid. You can private pay until you run out of money, and then get Medicaid. That's not what we did.

At first, the applicant had too much money (assets). 
Because the applicant was both under the age of 65 and disabled, we had the option to use a NYSARC pooled special needs trust to shelter the applicant's assets. We opened up a funeral trust and a special needs trust to shelter assets.

For the retirement account, we converted the asset to an income stream using monthly payments that were sufficiently large that they are expected to drain the retirement account before the applicant dies, using a social security administration (SSA) actuarial table.

The whole thing is super byzantine and took me almost a month to set up and document, but I was able to take care of everything without hiring a lawyer.

The applicant has too much income as well -- it's capped at $50/month income -- but that isn't disqualifying. It just means the applicant needs to pay the rest of the income to the nursing home each month.
